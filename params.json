Toolbox  for MATLAB  is a tool developed by University of Girona and University Polytechnic of Valencia to easily apply Interval MFA and Possibilistic MFA.\r\nInterval and Possibilistic MFA are extensions of traditional MFA, which is a widely used procedure to estimate the metabolic fluxes within living cells.\r\nThese methods, face some limitations that traditional MFA have. Particularly in scenarios of uncertainty —which are indeed common in research laboratories and industry environments—, where measurements are scarce and imprecise.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
