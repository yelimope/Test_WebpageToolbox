It has been developed by [Universitat de Girona](http://www.udg.edu/) and [Universidad Politécnica de Valencia](https://www.upv.es/).\r\n\r\nInterval and Possibilistic MFA are extensions of traditional MFA, which is a widely used procedure to estimate the metabolic fluxes within living cells.\r\nThese methods, face some limitations that traditional MFA have. Particularly in scenarios of uncertainty —which are indeed common in research laboratories and industry environments—, where measurements are scarce and imprecise.\r\n\r\n##  PFA Toolbox is:\r\n* Free.\r\n* Composed of simple MATLAB functions. \r\n* Very flexible, users can use in flexible ways and modified.\r\n* Compatible with COBRA, a well-known toolbox to work with constraint-based metabolic models. Any COBRA-compatible model can be used in P. Toolbox.\r\n\r\n## PFA Toolbox allow:\r\n* Compute reliable MFA estimations in uncertain (or underdetermined) scenarios, where only a few fluxes can be measured.\r\n* Calculate MFA estimations accounting for measurements imprecision.\r\n* Plot interval estimates and flux distributions.\r\n* Represent easily flux measurements in possibilistic terms with a Graphic User Interface (GUI).\r\n\r\nFor a better understanding of the tool and methods, we provide an _User's manual_ with several simple examples to illustrate the use of each of the functions. These information is available [here](http://francisco.llaneras.es/).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a complex case of use of the *PFA Toolbox* can be found in:\r\n>  _PFA Toolbox: a MATLAB toolbox for metabolic flux analysis_\r\n \r\n*****\r\n#Download\r\n\r\n*PFA Toolbox** is a set of MATLAB functions that require solving linear programming problems. To solve these problems, we use a flexible and efficient external optimizer: [YALMIP](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/). \r\n\r\nYou can download *PFA Toolbox* [here](https://github.com/kikollan/PFA-Toolbox) by clicking in *Download ZIP*\r\n****\r\n#Installation\r\n\r\nTo install the PFA Toolbox: \r\n\r\n1. Unzip PFA-Toolbox file. \r\n2. Copy the PFA Toolbox folder where you want it to be installed. \r\n3. Start MATLAB. \r\n4. Navigate to the PFA-toolbox/Toolbox_Code path\r\n5. Run the following script:\r\n>  _>>initPFAtoolbox_\r\n\r\nThis action will add the **PFA Toolbox** directories to your MATLAB path and run the initialization script of YALMIP. \r\n\r\n****\r\nAdditional information about us and our research:\r\n* [Modal Intervals and Control Engineering (MICELAB)](http://iiia.udg.edu/micelab/)\r\n* [Control of Complex Systems Group (CCSG)](https://gcsc.ai2.upv.es/)\r\n* [Francisco Llaneras](http://francisco.llaneras.es/) [Jesús Pico](https://gcsc.ai2.upv.es/content/jesus)\r\n\r\n\r\n*Acknowledgements*:This research has been partially supported by the Spanish Government (cicyt: DPI2011-28112-C04-01) and Biopolis S.L.
