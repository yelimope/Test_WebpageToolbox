Toolbox  for MATLAB  is a tool developed by University of Girona and University Polytechnic of Valencia to easily apply Interval MFA and Possibilistic MFA.\r\nInterval and Possibilistic MFA are extensions of traditional MFA, which is a widely used procedure to estimate the metabolic fluxes within living cells.\r\nThese methods, face some limitations that traditional MFA have. Particularly in scenarios of uncertainty —which are indeed common in research laboratories and industry environments—, where measurements are scarce and imprecise.\r\n\r\n##  P Toolbox is:\r\n* Free.\r\n* Composed of simple MATLAB functions. \r\n* Very flexible, users can use in flexible ways and modified.\r\n* Compatible with COBRA, a well-known toolbox to work with constraint-based metabolic models. Any COBRA-compatible model can be used in P. Toolbox.\r\n\r\n## P Toolbox allow:\r\n* Give reliable MFA estimations in uncertain (or underdetermined) scenarios, where only a few fluxes can be measured.\r\n* Provides MFA estimations accounting for measurements imprecision.\r\n* Ploting interval estimates and flux distributions.\r\n\r\n As a companion of the MATLAB functions, the P. Toolbox provides a Graphic User Interface (GUI) to represent the flux measurements in possibilistic terms. This has been the most difficult task to new users of Possibilistic MFA.  \r\n\r\n*****\r\n#INSTALLATION\r\n\r\n**PFA Toolbox** is a set of MATLAB functions that require solving linear programming problems. To solve these problems, we use a flexible and efficient external optimizer: [YALMIP](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/). \r\n\r\nYou can download the Toolbox with a copy of YALMIP [here](https://github.com/kikollan/PFA-Toolbox). Then to install: \r\n\r\n1.  Download and unzip the archive. \r\n2. Copy the PFA Toolbox folder where you want it to be installed. \r\n3. Start MATLAB. \r\n4. Navigate to the PFA toolbox path\r\n5. Run the following script:\r\n>   _>>initPFAtoolbox_\r\n\r\nThis action will add the **PFA Toolbox** directories to your MATLAB path and run the initialization script of YALMIP. \r\n****\r\n#DOCUMENTATION\r\nAdditionally to the PFA Toolbox we provide an User's manual and several simple example to illustrate the use of each of the functions.\r\nA complex case of use of the PFA Toolbox can be found in >_PFA Toolbox: a MATLAB toolbox for metabolic flux analysis_\r\n \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
